# Write code that's easy to extend and maintain
The overall performance of engineering teams is tightly related to developer experience. How easy it is for you as a developer to navigate through the code, to maintain and extend it, directly impacts the performance of your entire team.

This code is part of the Laracasts series for writing code that's easy to extend and maintain. In this series, we explore techniques for designing your code in a way that will make it easy to extend and maintain it in the long run, regardless if you get a clean slate or inherit a complex codebase. 

To make it easy to follow, we use a real-life example based on the payment functionality on [Adeva](https://adevait.com/), a platform that enables developers to get consulting opportunities with companies worldwide.
